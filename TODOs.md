# Styling

Animate router transitions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L77Uq93XXzk
Add resposive design


# Logic

!!! Can't delete some recipes for some reason. Something wrong with the router or json server and dynamic links

Change fetchData method in recipeview
Add error handling for fetch requests
Add spinners for loading data
Add 404
Add search
Add infinite scrolling
Add dynamic page titles for each route
Refactor props
Fix invalid prop type in recipe view

# Maybe
Create a mixin for fetching data to avoid repetition https://chafikgharbi.com/vuejs-global-function/
Add dark theme

# Polishing

Clean up CSS classes, especially in AddRecipe
Add flex and text align center utl classes to avoid css cluttering, espc. in AddRecipe
Figure out how to use postcss with you for autoprefixer
Add favicon
Look up how to register components globally (need to make the button global)
