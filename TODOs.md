# Styling

Re-style buttons, make small buttons 
Set min width for a card. And make sure they're always the same size no matter what 
Change add recipe default input styling (including focus)
Add animation to add/remove ingredient (there's a native Vue wave, look up in Notion notes)
Remove default indent on 1st line of textarea
Animate router transitions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L77Uq93XXzk
Make navbar sticky

# Sidebar

Add sidebar
Find icons for add (+), search

# Logic

!!! Can't delete some recipes for some reason. Something wrong with the router or json server and dynamic links

Change fetchData method in recipeview
Add error handling for fetch requests
Add spinners for loading data
Add 404
Add search
Add infinite scrolling
Add dynamic page titles for each route

# Maybe
Create a mixin for fetching data to avoid repetition https://chafikgharbi.com/vuejs-global-function/
